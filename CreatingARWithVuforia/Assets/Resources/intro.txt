Hello Detective, Last night at approximately 18:00 hours rangers found the partial remains of a deceased animal near the Galana River. Evidence points to it being one of the missing hippopotamus herd from the Kenyan Nana Miriam Wildlife Refuge. At 20:00 a sweep of the area recovered another animal but extensive damage to the artifact required the scanning and manufacture of a scanned and scaled model.
