Incisor

3D Model Analysis
The most striking aspect of the model is the missing incisor. The breakage is not consistent with injuries gained from fighting other hippos. Structural analysis of the break suggests that its loss was not an accident.

Fact
The only function of the incisors is for defense and fighting.

Okonkwo:
While itâ€™s not possible to determine the exact age of Okonkwo we estimated his age to be around 60. Incisors continously grow throughout its lifetime for a hippo of such advance age Okonkwo had smaller than average incisors.
